1. **Use Relevant Keywords**: Include industry-specific terms from the job description
2. **Quantify Achievements**: Use numbers and percentages to demonstrate impact

4. **Use Standard Job Titles**: Avoid creative titles that ATS systems might not recognize
5. **Include Certifications**: Add relevant certifications and credentials
6. **Optimize Skills Section**: List technical skills and tools mentioned in the job description

## Troubleshooting

2. **File Not Found**: Make sure your `_data` folder contains the required JSON files
3. **Low ATS Score**: Review missing keywords and consider adding relevant experience or skills

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all JSON files are properly formatted
2. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
3. Verify that the `_data` folder structure matches the expected format
